# Data-Analytics-Project---Power-BI--Hospital-Emergency-Room-Dashboard-

## Project Summary

The goal of this project was to develop an interactive and insightful Power BI dashboard for a hospital to monitor patient health metrics, track admissions, and improve decision-making for healthcare providers.

## Objectives 
The hospital faced challenges in analyzing patient data due to incomplete records, inconsistent data formats, and a lack of centralized tracking. This led to inefficiencies in patient care, difficulty in identifying high-risk patients, and delays in decision-making.

## Data Description 
The dataset used for this analysis includes comprehensive information about electric vehicles in the U.S. market. Key aspects of the data include:

Vehicle Specifications:
Attributes such as make, model, year, and manufacturer help establish the variety and diversity of EVs in the market.


## Data insights/Results  

Total Vehicles:
The total number of EVs in the dataset is 150.48k, with BEVs making up 117k (78%) and PHEVs 34k (22%).
Tesla leads the market with 69k vehicles (45.8% of the total EVs), but it only produces BEVs, highlighting its dominance in the fully electric segment.

## Recommendations
Focus on BEV Development:
Leverage Tesla’s dominance in the BEV segment to identify key features driving their success which can be looked into by the R&D Department. Elysium should prioritize BEV
