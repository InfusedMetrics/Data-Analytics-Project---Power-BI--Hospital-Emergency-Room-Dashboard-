# Data-Analytics-Project---Power-BI--Hospital-A&E-Room-Dashboard-

## Project Summary

The goal of this project was to develop 3 interactive and insightful Power BI dashboards for a hospital to monitor patient health metrics, track admissions, and improve decision-making for healthcare providers.

## Objectives 
The hospital faced challenges in analysing patient data due to incomplete records and inconsistent data formats. This led to inefficiencies in patient care, difficulty in identifying high-risk patients, and delays in decision-making. They have tasked me with creating these dashboards in order to enhance operational efficiency, enable stakeholders to track and analyse, also providing insights which will play a role in any future decison making regarding patient management and service optimisation. 

## Business Requirements / KPI's 
Number of patients:
- Measure total number of patients vititing the A&E Department daily.
Avergae Wait Time:
- Calculate the avergae wait time for patient efore being attended to by a medical professional.
Paitent Satsifaction Score:
- Anlayse the avergae satisfaction score of patients daily to evaluate the qulaity fo service provided.
Number of Patients Referred:
- Provide the count of paitents that have been referred to a specific department from A&E. 

  Dahsboard Requirements:
  - Dashboard 1 : Monthly View
  Objective: Monitor the key metrics and trends on a monthly basis to identify patterns and areas for improvements.
- Dashbaord 2: Consolidated View
Objective: Provide a comprehensive summary of the hospitals A&E department for a selected date range.
Dashboard 3 : Patients Details
Obejective: Provide a deeper insight into patient level data to enahnce detailed analaysis and fine-tuning.

Additional Dashboard 4: Findings/Summary

## Data Sources
* NHS UK health records - Emergency Care Data Set (ECDS)

## Data insights/Results  

Key Insights:

Patient Demographics:
Age Groups: Adults (30-39 years) formed the majority of patients (1,200 patients), followed by young adults (20-29 years) with 1,118 patients.

Race Distribution:

The largest racial group was White (28%, 2,571 patients), followed by African American (21%, 1,951 patients), Multiracial (17%, 1,557 patients), and Asian (11%, 1,060 patients).

A significant number of patients (11%, 1,030) declined to identify their racial background.

Peak Admission Days/Hours:
* Busiest Days: Saturday (1,377 patients, 14.94%), Thursday (1,332 patients, 14.45%), and Sunday (1,318 patients, 14.30%).

* Busiest Hours: 11 AM, 7 AM, 1 PM, and 11 PM, highlighting the need for ample staffing and optimization during these periods.

Patient Wait Time & Satisfaction:

*Average Wait Time: 35.3 minutes, indicating a need for improvement in patient flow.

*Average Satisfaction Score: 4.99 out of 10, suggesting moderate satisfaction and opportunities to enhance patient experiences.

Admission Patterns:

*Approximately half of all patients (4,612, 50.04%) were admitted, while the remaining (4,604, 49.95%) were treated and released.

Departmental Referrals:
A significant number of patients did not require a referral (5,400, 58.59%).
Among those referred, the most common departments were General Practice (1,840 cases), Orthopedics (995 cases), Physiotherapy (276 cases), and Cardiology (248 cases).

## Recommendations

Peak Admission Days/Hours:

* Provide these insights to the Operational Department to support in adjusting staffing requirments during peak days and hours to reduce wait times and improve patient care. More outreach from the comunication department on appointment scheduling to encourage patients with non-urgent conditions to visit during off-peak hours through targeted communication.

 Patient Wait Time & Satisfaction:
 
* Process Improvements: Implement process improvements to further reduce wait times for paitents
The Marketing Department should create a campaign to encourage patients to complete satisfaction surveys. For example:
Offer small incentives (eg. coffee vouchers) for completing surveys.

Admission Patterns:

* Follow-up care can be provided to improve follow-up care for discharged patients to reduce readmissions.
