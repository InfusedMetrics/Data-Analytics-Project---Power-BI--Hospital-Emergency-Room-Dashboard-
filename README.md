# Data-Analytics-Project---Power-BI--Hospital-A&E-Room-Dashboard-

## Project Summary

The goal of this project was to develop 3 interactive and insightful Power BI dashboards for a hospital to monitor patient health metrics, track admissions, and improve decision-making for healthcare providers.

## Objectives 
The hospital faced challenges in analysing patient data due to incomplete records and inconsistent data formats. This led to inefficiencies in patient care, difficulty in identifying high-risk patients, and delays in decision-making. They have tasked me with creating these dashboards in order to enhance operational efficiency, enable stakeholders to track and analyse, also providing insights which will play a role in any future decison making regarding patient management and service optimisation. 

## Business Requirements / KPI's 
Number of patients:
- Measure total number of patients vititing the A&E Department daily.
Avergae Wait Time:
- Calculate the avergae wait time for patient efore being attended to by a medical professional.
Paitent Satsifaction Score:
- Anlayse the avergae satisfaction score of patients daily to evaluate the qulaity fo service provided.
Number of Patients Referred:
- Provide the count of paitents that have been referred to a specific department from A&E. 

  Dahsboard Requirements:
  - Dashboard 1 : Monthly View
  Objective: Monitor the key metrics and trends on a monthly basis to identify patterns and areas for improvements.
- Dashbaord 2: Consolidated View
Objective: Provide a comprehensive summary of the hospitals A&E department for a selected date range.
Dashboard 3 : Patients Details
Obejective: Provide a deeper insight into patient level data to enahnce detailed analaysis and fine-tuning.

Additional Dashboard 4: Findings/Summary

## Data Sources
* NHS UK health records - Emergency Care Data Set (ECDS)

## Data insights/Results  

Total Vehicles:
The total number of EVs in the dataset is 150.48k, with BEVs making up 117k (78%) and PHEVs 34k (22%).
Tesla leads the market with 69k vehicles (45.8% of the total EVs), but it only produces BEVs, highlighting its dominance in the fully electric segment.

## Recommendations
Focus on BEV Development:
Leverage Tesla’s dominance in the BEV segment to identify key features driving their success which can be looked into by the R&D Department. Elysium should prioritize BEV
